# Abstract

The College of Engineering at Boise State University will host the 18th Annual Engineering and
Science Festival on February 22, 2025. This event aims to inspire over 4,000 K-12 students and their
families to explore STEM fields. To enhance the experience for attendees, our team is developing a
mobile-friendly web application that provides a comprehensive solution for navigating the festivalâ€™s
activities and campus facilities.

The proposed platform will offer features such as activity information, campus and internal building 
maps for navigation assistance, customizable schedules, filtering options, and an admin dashboard to
support dynamic changes. These interactive functionalities will replace the current static websites 
and provide a seamless experience for users.

By integrating these features into a single, easy to use web application, the platform aims to improve
user engagement, increase accessibility, and encourage repeat visits to the University. The enhanced
website will serve as an essential tool for managing the event and fostering a deeper connection
between Boise State University and the community.
